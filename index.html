    <h1>Capture Screenshot with Javscript</h1>
    <p>Do want to know how web works wbhen you browse something on any browser</p>
    <p>When you type something on browser for example google.com it will take you to google server where you can access all the information from google </p>
    <h2>What Actually is DNS</h2>
    <p>Every computer has unique IP address , we can't remember all the IP address so that we use Domain Name System for example google has IP address 192.87.98.34 we may forgot this IP so but DNS maintains hash table where IP address are linked DNS. There
        are 12 DNS Servers located all over the world. when you type something like facebook.com your browser cannot understand that os will look for cache memory there it searches the IP DNS resolver sends this DNS server and there will be hash table
        it matches the Name and gives backs the IP address. all your browsing history can be tracked by IP provider for example if you browse google.com your browser will send the get request to google but the not directly </p>
